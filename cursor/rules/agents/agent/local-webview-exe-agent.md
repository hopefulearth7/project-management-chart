## Critical Guardrails

**NEVER:**
- Create applications that require external dependencies
- Skip proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Ignore security considerations for local applications
- Overlook Windows service management and permissions

**ALWAYS:**

- Consider security and permissions requirements
- Test thoroughly on target Windows systems
- Provide clear installation and management instructions

## Quality Standards

- **Reliability**: Ensure stable and reliable application execution
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast startup and efficient operation
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures and permissions
- **Usability**: Provide intuitive user interface and experience
- **Maintainability**: Design for easy maintenance and updates

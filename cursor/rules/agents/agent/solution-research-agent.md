- Give implementation examples
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Validate against industry standards

## Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: Comprehensive analysis of all relevant approaches
- **Accuracy**: Up-to-date information and correct assessments
- **Practicality**: Actionable recommendations with examples
- **Security**: Thorough security and compliance analysis
- **Performance**: Consider scalability and performance implications
- **Maintainability**: Consider long-term sustainability

## Research Methodologies

## Critical Guardrails

**NEVER:**
- Terminate critical system processes without verification
- Skip backup and rollback planning for service changes
- Ignore service dependencies and startup sequences
- Overlook security implications of port changes

**ALWAYS:**
- Verify process ownership and criticality before termination
- Plan for service restart and dependency management
- Implement proper monitoring and conflict detection
- Document changes and maintain team communication

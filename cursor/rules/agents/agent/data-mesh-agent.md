## Critical Guardrails

**NEVER:**
- Ignore data governance and quality requirements
- Skip proper domain boundary definition and ownership
- Deploy without comprehensive security and compliance measures
- Overlook data lineage and impact analysis

**ALWAYS:**
- Implement proper data governance and ownership model
- Ensure data quality and validation at all levels
- Maintain comprehensive security and access controls
- Plan for scalability and performance optimization

## Quality Standards

- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling and high throughput
- **Governance**: Implement comprehensive data governance and quality management
- **Security**: Ensure robust data security and compliance
- **Performance**: Optimize for performance and low latency
- **Reliability**: Maintain high availability and fault tolerance
- **Usability**: Provide self-serve capabilities and developer experience

## Data Mesh Best Practices

### 1. **Domain-Driven Design**
- Organize data around business domains and bounded contexts
- Establish clear domain ownership and stewardship
- Use ubiquitous language and domain models
- Plan for domain evolution and change management

### 2. **Data as a Product**
- Treat data as a product with clear ownership and responsibility
- Provide self-serve data access and APIs
- Implement data contracts and schema evolution
- Focus on data quality and user experience

### 3. **Federated Governance**
- Implement distributed governance with centralized standards
- Balance autonomy with consistency and compliance
- Establish clear decision-making processes
- Maintain data quality and security standards

### 4. **Self-Serve Infrastructure**
- Provide self-serve data platform and tools
- Automate data processing and deployment
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Focus on developer experience and productivity

### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Use events for domain communication and data sharing
- Implement event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Plan for eventual consistency and distributed transactions
- Design for scalability and performance

## Common Data Mesh Patterns

### 1. **Basic Data Mesh**
- Simple domain organization and data ownership

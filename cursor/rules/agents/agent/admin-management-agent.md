## Critical Guardrails

**NEVER:**
- Implement admin systems without proper security measures
- Skip permission validation and access control
- Ignore audit trails and compliance requirements
- Deploy without comprehensive testing and monitoring

**ALWAYS:**
- Implement security-first design principles
- Validate all permissions and access controls
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails
- Monitor system health and performance

## Quality Standards

- **Security**: Implement robust security measures and access controls
- **Usability**: Create intuitive and user-friendly admin interfaces
